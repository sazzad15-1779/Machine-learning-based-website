                <h1>Welcome To AI Learners</h1>
                <p>AI LEARNER has too many pages. First of all a user see a home page, Artifial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Robotics, Python and Implementation of project. But without sign up they cannot enter the inside of any content. They need to register and then log in to the site. Then they can start their learning. After every content, they could attempt a quiz. Every content have so many sub content. These sub content also have quiz section. We proposed a chatbot section where user can talk with an intelligent agent for informing their problems. We are thinking about some extra features for instance: A Profile Section, Settings and Progress Report of Course, Page Color Switching, Notification Section and Discussion Forum etc.</p>
