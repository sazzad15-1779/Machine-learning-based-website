       <h1> Welcome to Python course </h1>
<p>Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.</p>
  <h2>Why to Learn Python?</h2>
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>  
<p>Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:</p>
<ul>
<li><h4>Python is Interpreted </h4>Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP. </li>
<li><h4>Python is Interactive </h4>You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
<li><h4>Python is Object-Oriented </h4>Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects</li>
</ul>
<h3>Characteristics of Python</h3>
<p>Following are important characteristics of Python Programming âˆ’</p>
<ul>
    <li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li>
    <li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li>
    <li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li>
    <li>It supports automatic garbage collection</li>
    <li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java</li>
</ul>
