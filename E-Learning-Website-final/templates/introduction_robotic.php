<h2>Robotics</h2>
<p>Robotics is a domain in artificial intelligence that deals with the study of creating intelligent and efficient robots.</p>
<h3>What is Robots?</h3>
<p>Robots are the artificial agents acting in real world environment.
Objective
Robots are aimed at manipulating the objects by perceiving, picking, moving, modifying the physical properties of object, destroying it, or to have an effect thereby freeing manpower from doing repetitive functions without getting bored, distracted, or exhausted.
</p>
<h4>Aspects of Robotics</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The robots have mechanical construction, form, or shape designed to accomplish a particular task.</li>
    <li>They have electrical components which power and control the machinery.</li>
    <li>â€¢	They contain some level of computer program that determines what, when and how a robot does something.</li>

</ul>
